# Supermarket Sales Analysis Report
This project analyzes supermarket sales data to identify key performance metrics, customer behavior, and product/category performance. The goal was to derive actionable insights that can assist in strategic decision-making.

Tools Used: Power BI, Microsoft Excel

Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chadwambles/supermarket-sales/data

Process:

Data Preparation:

Cleaned and structured the dataset to ensure accuracy in reporting.
Verified key fields like sales, revenue, and reward points.
Data Analysis and Visualization:

Created a Power BI dashboard to present insights visually.

Key visuals included:
Revenue and Sales Count Analysis by gender, city, and customer type.
Product Category Performance for sales and reward points.
Customer Distribution by city and type using stacked bar charts.

Key Findings:
Chicago generated the highest percentage of revenue among all cities.
Members contribute higher total revenue compared to Normal customers.
The Fruits and Personal Care categories were the top performers in sales count and reward points.
Male customers had slightly higher revenue contributions than female customers.
Results:
The dashboard provided clear insights into customer behavior, city-wise sales performance, and top-performing product categories, enabling data-driven decision-making for marketing and operations strategies.
